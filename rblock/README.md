Code to run the traditional Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM) on a network, given either continuous or categorical 
meta-data associated with the network's nodes [1]. Model selected using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach [2] (to complete), and block selection using an MCMC approach [3] (to complete).

The code should be viewed as work in progress. A starting point, to be extended, customised and applied to biomedical networks with a focus on patient networks with assocaited meta-data.
The code is build apon the work of Prof. M.E.J. Newman and associates. 

Extensions:

1) Likely patient networks will involved a similarity score, weighting, between patients.
